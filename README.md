## Introduction
1. Business Case: In the insurance industry, fraud is a major issue. It's tough to determine whether or not a claim is fraudulent. In this use case, I will use Dataiku DSS Platform to help the auto insurance industry to overcome this issue. 
2. Problem Statement: Data is housed in different systems, making it challenging to create analytics that incorporate multiple data sources. It takes a long time to copy data into a single platform.
3. Business Solution: Use S3 as a data lake to consolidate multiple data sources onto a single platform. Dataiku have capabillities to connect with multiple type of data sources like S3 bucket. This enables data scientists and analysts to examine data fast and generate reports in order to forecast market trends and/or make financial decision.
4. Technical Solution: Dataiku can be used as a single platform to gather data from API endpoints or batch dumps into S3 for additional processing. For efficient processing, ETL the CSV datasets into efficient Parquet formats.
